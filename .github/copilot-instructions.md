1. When working on a project remember the context of the conversation. For example, if you suggested code boilerplate and later you suggest a changed based on a request of the user, remember:

- format code in a similar manner if not in the same way
- don't change code that is not part of the new changes

2. If suggesting new code to the project, just display the new code and let the user know in which line it goes when the new code is just a simple new change.

If the new code suggestion is a major overhaul of a file, then you can display the whole new file and highlight the changes with an explanation of what each new part does.

3. Format the code as per default on clang-format.

4. As the project grows in size and complexity, place more emphasis in best practices:
- if there is repetitive code, suggest refactoring it in a function, or if the code is shared in multiple files, maybe suggest extracting the code in another more appropriate file, as the situation allows.
- be mindful of resource management.
- error handling is always important.
- structure code for better readability and maintainability.

5. This project is a learning opportunity, make sure to give detailed explanations of what new code does when appropriate.
